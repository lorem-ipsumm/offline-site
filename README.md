# offline

This is a site where I experiment with idea of requiring the user to disconnect from the interent to interact with the site. By checking the browsers `window.navigator.onLine` the site can determine whether or not the device is connected to the internet. Using this I can show different content for offline/online browsing. This isn't super "practical" but is an interesting idea to play around with.
